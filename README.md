# SHAPES, HOVER, AND UL
## INTRODUCTION
 
The project consists of displaying two squares, each one with a different colour. One of the squares needs to change colour and transform onto a circle when the pointer is on the other square. On each shape we place an unordered list (ul) which contains as items (li) the names of different meals.
